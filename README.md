<h2 id="nlw"> What's Next Level Week? </h2>
<p>Next Level Week is an online and completely free event that offers a week of intensive training in the development of a web application.<br></br>
The event is provided by Rocketseat and has the clear objective of collaborating in the evolution of our career as a dev and taking us to the next level with focus, practice and group work.
